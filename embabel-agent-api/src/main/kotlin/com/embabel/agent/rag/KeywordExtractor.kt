     * generous to partial matches while still giving diminishing returns. For example, matching
     * 2 out of 15 keywords yields ~0.45 rather than 0.13, reflecting that even partial matches
     * can be quite valuable.
     *
     * The formula is: (matchCount / totalKeywords)^0.4

     * This approach aligns with information retrieval principles where early matches are most
     * significant, but avoids being overly harsh on documents that match only a subset of keywords.
